# Scalable, collaborative resolution standards

The [**AI Forecasting Resolution Dictionary**](https://parallel-forecast.github.io/AI-dict/) is a set of standards and conventions for precisely interpreting AI and auxiliary terms.

## Why build a dictionary?

The future is big. To model and forecast it, we’re going to need to put probabilities on *a lot* of questions.

The AI Dictionary is one piece of the puzzle for improving discussions about the future of AI, and for assisting comparability of different forecasts or elicitations. This is critical for improving collaboration, and for unlocking economies-of-scale for AI forecasting.

### Low overhead

When writers don’t have to reinvent the wheel whenever they operationalise a new thought, and forecasters can reduce the drag of constantly interpreting new resolutions, we can both generate and answer more questions.

### High signal

Capturing what matters in a detailed, technical question is hard. We can make that high initial cost worth it by ensuring it is broadly used and built upon.

### Stable yet flexible

Drawing upon best practices for software version management, we can allow resolution conditions that change and improve over time while maintaining the precision necessary for quantitative reasoning.

## How do I use the Dictionary?

Simply write a question relying on definitions from the Dictionary, and appending the tag [ai-dict-vX.Y.Z] at the end of the relevant string, or somewhere in an accompanying description.

For example:

`I predict that image classification will be made robust against
adversarial examples by 2023. [ai-dict-v2]`

`Will there be a superhuman Starcraft agent trained using less than $10.000 of publicly available compute by 2025? [ai-dict-v1.0.4]`
